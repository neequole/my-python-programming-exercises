"""  Question 66:

The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:


f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1

Please write a program using list comprehension to print the Fibonacci Sequence
in comma separated form with a given n input by console.

Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:

7

Then, the output of the program should be:

0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13


Hints:
We can define recursive function in Python.
Use list comprehension to generate a list from an existing list.
Use string.join() to join a list of strings.

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
